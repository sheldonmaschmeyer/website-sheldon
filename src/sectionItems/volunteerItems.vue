        ▪ Donated to UNRWA <br />
        The terrorist attack on Israel is horrific. <br />
        The organization was compromised by a few extremists who carried out, or
        facilitated, the horrible murders, rapes and kidnappings. The United
        Nations Relief and Works Agency is one of the only organizations that is
        still operating in war zones within Gaza. <br />
        They have fired the bad apples who were involved with the terrorist
        attacks on Israel and the Canadian government, after an investigation,
        actively donates to UNRWA. <br />
        War is a form of hell on earth. Innocent civilians, many children, need
        food, medicine and shelter. Since the terrorists hide and fight amongst
        civilians, using them as human shields, the task of humanitarian
        assistance is precarious.

        ▪ Donated to the Ottawa Food Bank <br />
        I live downtown Ottawa. There are pockets poverty and hunger throughout
        Canada. What separates us from a homeless, malnourished individual is a
        thin-red-line. <br />
        I donate money rather than groceries to food banks since, the charities
        are able to use the funds for the services and items that are urgently
        needed. Before university, I volunteered at the Aurora Food Pantry. I
        went through boxes, throwing out expired items. They would have an
        abundance of some items such as peanut butter but, limited in items for
        children and adult dietary requirements such as fresh milk and eggs. The
        food bank, through monetary donation, may purchase what is urgently
        required rather than what we think they need.

        ▪ Donated to the Provincial Liberal Party <br />
        Doug Ford has been in office for almost seven years and his party's
        cronyism is only getting worse. It is time for a change of government.
        <br />
        I believe that Bonnie Crombie will be a fantastic Premier of Ontario.
        Challenging a potential future federal Conservative government. <br />
        Like my father, I often work on for start-ups, on contract, with no
        insurance or, costly monthly private insurance. I am fortunate to be in
        good health. <br />
        Fighting for universal healthcare, reducing wait times and increasing
        accessibility to family doctors. I do not currently have a family doctor
        but, I am again on a government wait list. My previous doctor moved and,
        was at a costly distance (via. Uber) and time-consuming distance from my
        place of residence. <br />
        Improved affordability of housing and rent for both the middle class
        and, low income families. <br />
        While I greatly respect the NDP and the Green Party, in Ontario, I
        believe that the Liberals, in the long-term, have the best chance to
        form a stable government that can implement important legislation and
        lasting change.

        ▪ Donated the Canadian Legion <br />
        My partner and I donate annually to the legion, normally cash. <br />
        This year we decided to donate through the legion.ca website for two
        ceramic poppies. Due to the Canada Post strick, the ceramic poppies will
        likely arrive by mail in time for next year's Remembrance Day.
