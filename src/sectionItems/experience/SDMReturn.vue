    In October I returned to Shoppers, my previous student job, while looking
    for new career opportunities that utilize aspects of my Bachelor of Science
    and/or Bachelor of Computer Science degrees. <br />
    <br />
    I was asked to return by the store owner while getting the flu shot. The job
    allow me to cover basic expenses and keep a good credit rating while I
    continue to look for career opportunities. <br />
    <br />
    My last day, due to a new career opportunity, was March 17, 2023.
