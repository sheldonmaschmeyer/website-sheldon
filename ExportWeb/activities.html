Recreational racket sports (badminton or tennis) and jogging.

<div>Cycle as a means of transportation more than recreation
(Uber used more frequently).</div>

<div>Favourite genre is sci-fi and fantasy
(i.e. new Star Trek, Star Wars, Orville, House of the Dragon, Doctor Who).</div>

<div>I frequently watch sci-fi with my girlfriend and, 
a nearby friend (a former housemate who is a laboratory coordinator).</div>

I daily keep up-to-date with current events.

Hangout with friends and girlfriend. 
When I was a kid, Scouts Canada from 1992 - 2003.
